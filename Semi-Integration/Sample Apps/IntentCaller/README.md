# IntentCaller
This is a sample application showing how to send/receive SmartConnect messages from the Nexgo Integrator application. 

> You can import/open this project directly into Android Studio. 

The application is setup to send a test 'Sale' transaction to Integrator for processing. If the user signs on the screen, the application will print the signature and then display the JSON response from the transaction.
