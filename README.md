Nexgo is focused on providing hardware and software solutions to the Payments industry. Our current line of point-of-sale terminals runs a customized and hardended version Android operating system that has been certified with PCI. Due to the prevelence of Android in the "wild", outside developers will find it exceedingly easy to create/port software solutions on the Nexgo devices. 

This repository  will focus on [2] main scenarios:
  1. Providing the ability to use Semi-Integration to allow 3rd parties to easily take payments using our pre-certified payment applications. Our Semi-Integration solution is called *SmartConnect* on the Android devices, and it allows initiating payment transactions by sending a message to our payment application over standard Android 'Intents' or standard TCP. 
  2. Providing the ability to use our device SDK to allow 3rd parties to create their own solutions from the ground up using the integrated  MSR/EMV/NFC readers, printer, and other hardware on the device.
