Nexgo is a company focused on providing hardware and software solutions to the Payments industry. Our current line of terminals runs on a customized and hardended version Android operating system. Due to the prevelence of Android in the wild, outside developers will find it exceedingly easy to create software solutions with the Nexgo devices. 

We focus on [3] main scenarios:
  1. Allowing outside parties to use Semi-Integration to process payments using our pre-certified payment applications. 
  2. Allowing outside parties the ability to create their own payment application using our device and its SDK. 
  3. Allowing outside parties to create their own solutions that may be outside of payments, such as ticketing and registration. 
  
This repository will provide the information necessary to get you off the ground and to begin integrating into the Nexgo family of devices.
